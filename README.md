# node-next

visit : https://node-next.vercel.app/

This is a full-stack project of mine. I used Next js, redux, react-bootstrap on the frontend and Node, express, jwt and mongodb on the backend. 

It taught me alot and I now think myself as a capable and wise full stack developer

There are still changes to be made on this project, Alot of features to add, I have decided to add them incrementally as I move on, and maybe release as 
a startup, but for now, it will make a fine addition to my collection.
